VainSabers is a blursaber mod for beat saber, like ReeSabers but worse.

`VainSabers` is the source project, which has the main mod code. `VainSabers asset creation` is the unity project used to create the asset bundle used, and also has some code adapted from the mod to help visualize stuff.

This is somewhat buggy in its current state. It works well once you get it going and all configured, but it's not exactly the most user friendly.
