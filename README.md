VainSabers is a blursaber mod for beat saber, like ReeSabers but worse.

*this seems to be incompatible with customsaberslite, so disable whichever one you aren't using at the moment*
This is somewhat buggy in its current state. It works well once you get it going and all configured.

`VainSabers` is the source project, which has the main mod code. `VainSabers asset creation` is the unity project used to create the asset bundle used, and also has some code adapted from the mod to help visualize stuff.
